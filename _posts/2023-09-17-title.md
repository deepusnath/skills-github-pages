µLearn is an industry-enabled digital platform for peer-learning, facilitated by GTech Academia and Technology Focus Group. Through µLearn, the young generation will network, collaborate, learn and showcase their skills to the outside world. The platform envisions building a robust framework for developing Kerala's knowledge economy, helping the youth connect to their affinity space, and giving them an inventory of opportunities that change them as Innovators and Entrepreneurs of the future.

Intending to bridge the gap between students and industries, the µLearn framework integrates participants such as students, universities, colleges, industries, communities, and learning programs into a holistic system through microlearning groups of peers.
